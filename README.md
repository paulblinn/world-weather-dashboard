# World Weather Dashboard
Weather forecasts are useful, but historical weather data can also provide useful insights into what the weather may be like when traveling to a destination.  To address this, I decided to create a World Weather Dashboard that displays the most important metrics to consider when making travel plans for various destinations around the world. I used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository) I found on Kaggle, which contains daily weather data from many cities around the globe.
