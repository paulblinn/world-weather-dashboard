# World Weather Dashboard
Weather forecasts are useful, but historical weather data can also provide insights into what the weather was like when planning a trip to a destination. However, most weather applications only show forecasts, and it is difficult to find historical weather data that contains common metrics used to make travel plans. To address this problem, I decided to create a World Weather Dashboard with Power BI that displays historical data with the most important metrics to consider when making travel plans for various destinations around the world. I used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository) I found on Kaggle, which contains weather data from many cities around the globe and is updated daily.
